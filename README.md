# State form mixin

A mixin to help maintain state inside a component and keep all state management consistent through all forms

Lots to do before this is ready for any usage

- Rename method so they are clearly defined
- Rename properties
- Refactor code
- Add tests

This feature was used in production on a codebase and worked very well, time to tidy it up and make it reusable.
